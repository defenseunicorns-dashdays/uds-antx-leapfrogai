And so if there's a call going through on the green radio, that he might not hear it if he's fully in on the headset. Our thought was, okay, well, there's a bunch of NAVOR folks in there. Honestly, I grabbed the first one that I saw. The one that came up to me was like, hey, what can I do? Like, perfect. I'm like, but he's probably not the right person for that. I don't know if it's... That's what I kind of thought, figured would happen."
- {Tracks.track4.value}: "Is that independent? Oh no, I didn't even hear it. Is there volume on this? What is this? Oh, independent. Oh my gosh. I've been here a year. All right. Again, I cannot stress this enough, comms is not my day job. It is today, but..."

I'm just going to set this to one. If anything, you start to angle out of the box a little bit, just change a little bit. So definitely stay within it.

EXAMPLE 4: Trial Start prediction

If we go into another PR, we're like, trying to figure shit out, at that point I would say we'll do, you got it.",

Yeah, I think of like a Ross bag or like you can still pop up in Arviz being able to do some version like that and see it propagate. Yeah, right. Yeah, let's put this on to. I'm curious at field events how much of the runway for the next series of dev presses gets generated. that's like, okay, so this is the first action that I'm hearing out of this. We're like, okay, here's a mole update. Is that a normal thing that happens at these?"

- {Tracks.track3.value}: "They're new? Okay, I'm not going crazy. They should find a boat soon, huh? What are you guys able to see on your screen? Anthony, can I ask you a question? What's going on in that window? I think I made a folder. This is getting out of hand, going to declare a mistrial."
- {Tracks.track4.value}: "So one more thing to give us heads up on the way in these are supposed to go 20 meters off they see something that's supposed to go around it kind of thing. They don't always do that. So like Tango 10 and Tango 20 are going right towards each other. Just be ready to do evasive maneuvers if it looks like they're like going head on. Like that one I'd zoom way in. Maybe go the circle thing. Really like the circle thing where it says like 50 meter offset or 10 meter offset, whatever it's at. The ring, yeah. Bump that to 30 meters or so, yeah. And does it, oh. Very bottom right, the lock. Yeah. And then zoom way in. Yeah. So, if it looks like within like 30 meters, how does it start going right towards each other? Yeah, you're absolutely good."

user = '''
As context you will be given a Current State and a series of radio transmissions broken out into separate tracks. 
The transmissions represent dialogue between stakeholders involved in maritime UAV test and evaluation trials.\n  
Given the context perform the following two sequential tasks:
1. Decide if a change to the Current State is warranted given the transmissions. 
   - If no change is warranted simply return a json object as follows:
   - Output: {{"current_state": "<current state>"}}\n
2. Based on your decision from step 1, if a change in state is warranted then choose from among the next state options and return your output to include, current state, predicted state, and your reasoning for choosing the next predicted state.  Follow the output guidelines below:
    - Output: {{"predicted_state": "<predicted state>", "reason": "<reason you chose the predicted state>"}}\n

EXAMPLES
--------------------------
Use the following examples as your guide for predicting whether or not to change the state and if so, what to predict:
{examples}
--------------------------

Current State: {current_state}
Radio Transmissions:
{transmissions}
Potential next state options: {next_state_options}
